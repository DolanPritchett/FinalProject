Hi students,

The course project code review will be from April 12th to April 18th.

The project integrates a MIMO detector with either a Turbo decoder or an LDPC decoder.

Two test set files are provided here. Test Set 1 is for the MIMO detector only, and Test Set 2 is designed for the Iterative MIMO-Turbo detector.

The new component of the project is the MIMO detector.

Since you already have a working Turbo decoder and an LDPC decoder is provided, Test Set 1 is intended to verify the functionality of your MIMO detector.

If your MIMO detector performs well on Test Set 1, the next step is to integrate it with the Turbo or LDPC decoder.

This integration is clearly explained in Professor Chen’s lecture. I strongly recommend watching the lecture videos carefully before implementing this part.

Test Set 2 will help you evaluate the integration by testing the Iterative MIMO-Turbo detection.

For the Code Review, you are required to submit the following four outputs:

1. MIMO Detector Code Review Output
Refer to the attached file ‘Course Project Code Review Input.txt’, apply the input to your MIMO detector (not the joint iterative MIMO-Turbo detector), and submit your results in the same format as Test Set 1.

2. Joint Iterative MIMO-Turbo Detector Code Review Output
Using the same input file ‘Course Project Code Review Input.txt’, apply the input to your Joint Iterative MIMO-Turbo detector and submit your results in the same format as Test Set 2.

3. BER values of MIMO-Turbo
Eb/No: 0, 1, 2, 2.4, 2.8, 3, 3.4

4. BER values of MIMO-LDPC
Eb/No: 0, 1, 2, 2.4, 2.8, 3, 3.4

Best regards,
Joo
