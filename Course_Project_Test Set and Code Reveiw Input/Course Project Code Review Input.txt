In order for you to match the answers for the MIMO detector test case, 
please use the following definition of the QPSK constellation:

(1+j) corresponds to bit1=0  bit2=0 
(-1+j) corresponds to 0 1
(-1-j) corresponds to 1 1
(1-j) corresponds to 1 0

This means that we set Es=2, and the noise level should be 
calculated according to Equation (31) in Hochwald's paper 
"Achieving near-capacity on a multiple-antenna channel". 

Consider one transmission from two TX/RX antennas corresponding to
four bits (two QPSK symbols): b0, b1, b2, b3.
Assume that
Eb/N0=2db (following the definition given in the paper)
Y1=[1+1.5j; 2-0.2j];
H1=[-0.9 + 2j 0.2 + 2j ; -0.3-1j 2.5+0.5j];

=======================================================

Joint MIMO detection and turbo decoding:

Let's use the same rate 1/2 (7,5) turbo code as in Hw5
Assume that the input has length 8 (including 2 termination bits)
Turbo Interleaver for 8 bits
[2  1  7 5  3  6  8  4]

channel interleaver for 16 bits
[3 8 14 1 5 4 10 9 11 16 15 12 13 6 7 2]

Use a MIMO channel with two transmit and two receive antennas.
Each time we transmit two QPSK symbols. It takes 4 transmissions
for 8 QPSK symbols.

Eb/N0=2db (following the definition given in the paper)

H_i the channel matrix for the i-th transmission (channel use)

H1=[-0.9 + 2j 0.2 + 2j ; -0.3-1j 2.5+0.5j];
H2=[j -0.1+j; 0.5+j 0.5j];
H3=[-0.9 + 0.7j 1-0.2j; 0.5+0.5j 0.3+0.2j];
H4=[-0.6-0.5j -0.8+1j; 0.6-2j -0.7+0.2j];

Assume that Y_i is the received signal from the two receive antennas for the i-th channel use
Y_i=H_i*X_i+W_i:

Y1=[1+1.5j; 2-0.2j];
Y2=[-2+j -0.6+1.4j];
Y3=[0.6-0.2j; 1.3-0.5j];
Y4=[-1+0.8j -1-0.4j];

Perform one iteration of MIMO detection followed by two (inner) iterations of turbo decoding.
